# Welcome to the Tip Calculator tutorial!

This short tutorial should walk you through the process of creating a simple web application.

------------


##Setting Up
You must have a browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred) and a text editor (like Atom) installed. Create a folder for your project's files named "Tip Calculator". Finally, download the AppDevExamples repository [here](https://github.com/rkanderson/AppDevExamples/archive/master.zip) and place the contents of **Mini Project Template** in your folder.

Most text editors have some feature that allows you to view and interact with your project file structure. It's best to use these features when editing multiple files. For atom, either drag your project folder into the editor, or select your folder though file --> open. You should see something like this:

For now, testing your app is as simple as opening up index.html in your browser and hitting the refresh button every time you want to test a new change. Try double clicking on index.html, you should see the following display in your browser:
