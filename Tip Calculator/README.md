# Welcome to the Tip Calculator tutorial!

This short tutorial should walk you through the process of creating a simple web application.

------------


## Setting Up

You must have a browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred) and a text editor (like Atom) installed. Create a folder for your project's files named "Tip Calculator". Finally, download the AppDevExamples repository [here](https://github.com/rkanderson/AppDevExamples/archive/master.zip) and place the contents of **Mini Project Template** in your folder.

Most text editors have some feature that allows you to view and interact with your project file structure. It's best to use these features when editing multiple files. For atom, either drag your project folder into the editor, or select your folder though file --> open. You should see something like this:

For now, testing your app is as simple as opening up index.html in your browser and hitting the refresh button every time you want to test a new change. Try double clicking on index.html, you should see the following display in your browser:

## Building the User Interface

### Preview

There are several possible patterns for development. Some prefer to construct a minimal UI and jump straight into programming. We, however, will begin by creating most of what we need in terms of UI.
The following image represents our goal:

### Centering Rule
The first thing you may notice is that everything is centered both horizontally and vertically. There is a simple css trick to establish this centering rule for the entire page. Add the following code to styles.css

```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
}

body {
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
}
```

Refresh your page, and you'll already see the "Hello World" h1 tag centered vertically. 
In index.html, change the h1 tag to read "Tip Calculator" instead of "Hello World" and give it a text-center class. The h1 should look like this:

```html
<h1 class="text-center">Tip Calculator</h1>
```
  
And you should see the following upon refreshing your browser:

Now time to create the more important ui pieces...

### Text Fields

Bootstrap has a nice pre-built system for text fields as well as many other input components like drop down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and file choosers. When you develop using any library, it's impossible to know how to do everything straight off your head. That's why you can use the power of the internet to quickly learn what you want. Simply googling **"[_Library Name_] how to make/use ___________"** almost always gives you what you need (often a question posted on Stack Overflow). In our case, we might google "Bootstrap how to make text fields," but what's even better is to have Bootstrap's official documentation handy-- because googling everything is sometimes tedious. Bootstrap's component documentation can be found [here](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/)

Recall that bootstrap works by structuring your webpage into rows with independent numbers of columns. Our h1 tag is currently in its own row, so we need to make a new one for the text fields. Then within that row, we need two column divs (div with class="col"), one for each text field. Modify the code within the container div so it looks like this:

```html
  <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <h1 class="text-center">Tip Calculator</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          I'm the first column!
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          I'm the 2nd column!
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
The following screenshot has been color coded to show the column structure. The container is yellow, the two new columns are red and green. Our h1 has been given no background color. Notice how the two columns only appear the second row (where we added the two column divs)

Try changing the width of your window. Notice how the content adapts? Bootstrap is good at that kind of thing.
Now we need to actually add the code for the text fields. This is where we can use that documentation. Documentation on text fields can be found in the "Forms" section on the Bootstrap components page (here's the [link](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/) again). 

The Documentation indicates that all bootstrap form inputs must have the class "form-control" be nested within a div with a class of "form-group". Our 2nd row surrounding div is a good spot to place our "form-control" class. As for the textual inputs, it's a matter of copying and pasting from the documentation!
Modify your code to look like this:

```html
  <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <h1 class="text-center">Tip Calculator</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row form-group"> <!--We added the form-group class here!-->
        <div class="col">
          <!--This is the first column!-->
          <label for="bill-field">Bill</label> <!--This label tells the user what the text field is for and has a "for" attribute with the id of the text-field. -->
          <input id="bill-field" class="form-control" type="text"> <!--This input has the form-control class. That tells bootstrap to style it!-->
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <!--This is the second column-->
          <label for="percent-tip-field">Percent Tip</label>
          <input id="percent-tip-field" class="form-control" type="text">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

> The input tag is a standard HTML5 element. For more documentation specifically on the input tag, visit a site such as W3Schools.

Your refreshed page should look something like this: (without the colors)

### Button
Now we need a big button that says calculate! Buttons are the first thing mentioned in the Bootstrap components documentation! Check it out!
The documentation tells us that we need to use an HTML button tag and give it the class "btn" to tell Bootstrap that it should be styled. In addition, we can provide a second class that tells bootstrap just exactly what pre-defined style category the button fits into (primary, secondary, info, warning, etc). We should use class "btn-primary" since it's our most important (and only!) button on screen. Finally, we have several classes at our disposal that let us determine the size and shape of the button. "btn-lg" makes the button nice and big, and the "btn-block" class makes the button horizontally span its entire parent, which is closest to what we want. Our final button tag looks like this:

```html
<button id="calculate-button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Calculate!</button>
```

And now we need to add that to a new row with just a single column (for now). Do you know how? See if you can do it on your own. Or just copy the code below, you dirty cheater.
```html
<div class="row"> <!--This entire row div goes just below the closing </div> tag for the row div that contained both text-fields-->
	<div class="col">
		<button id="calculate-button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Calculate!</button>
	</div>
</div>
```

Your refreshed page should look like the following image. The new button has been given its own snazzy purple box for color coding purposes.
